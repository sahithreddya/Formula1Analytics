I took the constructors' data specifically and tried to find insights from a 70+ year-old dataset.
Through these explorations, the performance of constructors over the years was made evident. Williams, being one of the oldest teams had seen success in the early years of the sport, but as the seasons progressed, they hadn't been performing well. This reduced the 'effectiveness' of their results. Some of the relatively newer teams such as Mercedes have the most efficacy in terms of results as they've held eight constructor championships in the last ten years of F1 racing.
